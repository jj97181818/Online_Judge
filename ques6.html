				<h3>Minesweeper</h3>
				<div id="article">
					<div style="text-align: left;">
						<h4>Intro:</h4>
						<blockquote>
							Have you ever played Minesweeper? It’s a cute little game which comes within a certain Operating System which name we can’t really remember. Well, the goal of the game is to find where are all the mines within a M ×N field. To help you, the game shows a number in a square which tells you how many mines there are adjacent to that square. For instance, supose the following 4 ×4 field with 2 mines (which are represented by an ‘*’ character):<br><br>
							*...<br>....<br>.*..<br>....<br><br>
							If we would represent the same field placing the hint numbers described above, we would end up with:<br><br>
							*100<br>2210<br>1*10<br>1110<br><br>
							As you may have already noticed, each square may have at most 8 adjacent squares.
						</blockquote>
						<h4>Input:</h4>
						<blockquote>
							The input will consist of an arbitrary number of fields. The first line of each field contains two integers n and m (0 < n, m ≤100) which stands for the number of lines and columns of the field respectively. The next n lines contains exactly m characters and represent the field.<br>
							Each safe square is represented by an ‘.’ character (without the quotes) and each mine square is represented by an ‘*’ character (also without the quotes). The first field line where n = m = 0 represents the end of input and should not be processed.
						</blockquote>
						<h4>Output:</h4>
						<blockquote>
							For each field, you must print the following message in a line alone:<br>
							Field #x:<br>
							Where x stands for the number of the field (starting from 1). The next n lines should contain the field with the ‘.’ characters replaced by the number of adjacent mines to that square. There must be an empty line between field outputs.
						</blockquote>
						<h4>Sample Input:</h4>
						<blockquote>
							4 4<br>
							*...<br>
							....<br>
							.*..<br>
							....<br>
							3 5<br>
							**...<br>
							.....<br>
							.*...<br>
							0 0
						</blockquote>
						<h4>Sample Output:</h4>
						<blockquote>
							Field #1:<br>
							*100<br>
							2210<br>
							1*10<br>
							1110<br><br>
							Field #2:<br>
							**100<br>
							33200<br>
							1*100
